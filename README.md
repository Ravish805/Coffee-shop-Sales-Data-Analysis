# Coffee-shop-Sales-Data-Analysis
Description
This project analyzes sales data from a coffee shop to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and operational performance. By leveraging Power BI for visualization, we aim to provide a comprehensive, interactive dashboard that stakeholders can use to make data-driven decisions.

Data and Methodology
Data Collection: Gather sales data from the coffee shopâ€™s point-of-sale (POS) system. This dataset includes transaction dates, product names, quantities sold, prices, and total sales amounts.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Use tools like Python or Excel to clean and prepare the data for analysis, addressing issues such as missing values and data inconsistencies.
